## Understand what kubernetes doesnt do and explain in your own words.
Kubernetes differs from traditional all-in-one PaaS systems. Operating at the container level instead of hardware, it shares some PaaS features like deployment and scaling. Users can integrate logging, monitoring, and alerting, but Kubernetes is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's modular, allowing optional and customizable default solutions. While offering building blocks for developer platforms, Kubernetes prioritizes user choice and flexibility.

## What other Orchestration tools are available other than Kubernetes
Several orchestration tools are available, each with its own strengths and use cases. Some notable alternatives to Kubernetes include:

Docker Swarm: A native clustering and orchestration solution for Docker.
Apache Mesos: A general-purpose cluster manager that supports distributed applications.
Amazon ECS: A fully managed container orchestration service provided by Amazon Web Services.
OpenShift: An enterprise Kubernetes platform with additional developer and operational tools.
Nomad: An open-source scheduler and orchestrator by HashiCorp, designed for simplicity and flexibility.
Docker Compose: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
Rancher: An open-source platform for managing and deploying containers in production.
