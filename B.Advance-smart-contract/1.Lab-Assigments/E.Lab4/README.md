# Diamond Proxy Pattern Contract

A Solidity implementation of the Diamond proxy pattern, allowing contracts to inherit behavior from multiple other contracts while maintaining a consistent storage layout.

## Overview

- **Diamond Contract**: The main contract that delegates calls to its facets.
- **Facets**: Contracts that contain specific functionalities which can be attached to or detached from the Diamond.

## Features

- **Delegated Functionality**: The Diamond contract can execute functions defined in its facets, allowing modular and upgradable behavior.
- **Storage Consistency**: Despite the flexible function calls, the storage layout remains consistent, preventing potential storage collisions.
- **Owner Managed**: The Diamond owner can assign facets to specific functions or replace existing facets.

## Functions

1. `setFacet(bytes4 _functionSelector, address _facetAddress)`: For the Diamond owner to set or replace a facet for a specific function.
2. `increment()`: A sample function in the Facet contract that can be executed via the Diamond.

## Issues & Considerations

- Ensure you understand the storage layout and the potential risks of storage collisions when adding new facets.
- The current setup supports the `increment` function. To make the Diamond more versatile, consider allowing any function selector to be assigned to a facet.
